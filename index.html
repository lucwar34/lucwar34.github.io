        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>
            I am a college student pursuing a career in <span class="highlight">IT and Cybersecurity</span>, with a strong
            interest in how systems work beneath the surface. While much of my formal experience comes from coursework,
            I’ve intentionally focused on gaining hands-on exposure by building and experimenting with real systems on my own.
        </p>

        <p>
            I began creating home lab projects because I didn’t want my understanding of technology to remain purely inside the classroom.
            I wanted to know what actually happens when an operating system boots, how networking services interact, 
            and how to fix what breaks when configurations are incorrect. Learning through direct experimentation, mistakes and all,
            has been one of the most valuable parts of my development in understanding doftware and hardware systems.
        </p>

        <h2>How I Learn</h2>

        <p>
        My approach to learning is simple: build something, fix inevitable issues, and document what I learned.
        Through this process, I completed three hands-on projects that were both practically useful in my own environment
        and directly applicable to real-world IT concepts. These included deploying TrueNAS as a personal cloud storage
        solution, configuring a network-wide DNS filtering service using Pi-hole to block advertisements at the router level,
        and experimenting with virtualization software to understand how virtual machines operate.
        </p>

        <p>
            Many of these projects started with little prior knowledge. I relied heavily on documentation,
            trial and error, and iterative improvement. This process helped me develop not only technical skills,
            but also persistence and confidence in navigating ambiguity — skills I believe are critical in IT and security roles.
        </p>

        <section>
    <h2>Projects Overview:</h2>

    <p>
        My learning process is largely driven by hands-on experimentation. While coursework introduced many of the core
        concepts, my understanding deepened when I was able to apply them through projects that were both practical and
        personally useful. The following projects represent key points in that learning process.
    </p>

    <h3>Virtualization & Linux Command Line</h3>

    <p>
        My exposure to virtualization began in a Computer Operating Systems course, where we were required to run a
        virtual machine hosted on a remote computer lab provided by the university. The process involved accessing the
        lab environment, installing Ubuntu, and configuring virtual machine specifications using VirtualBox.
    </p>

    <p>
        Once the virtual machine was configured, much of our interaction took place through the Linux command line.
        Because the virtual machines were hosted remotely, I continue to access my VM by remotely connecting to a school
        computer and launching it from there whenever I want to experiment or practice.
    </p>

    <p>
        This experience became particularly useful in a later C Programming for Engineers course, where I was required
        to use a Unix-based terminal environment to navigate directories, compile programs, and execute code. Having
        already spent time working in Ubuntu and the Linux CLI made the transition to the macOS terminal (which is
        Unix-based) far more intuitive.
    </p>

    <h3>TrueNAS & Personal Storage Server</h3>

    <p>
        To gain experience with storage and server administration, I repurposed an old laptop by installing TrueNAS as
        a dedicated operating system. This required identifying compatible hardware, installing a new OS from scratch,
        and configuring the system remotely from another computer using TrueNAS’s web interface.
    </p>

    <p>
        With storage hardware becoming increasingly expensive in recent months, particularly due to shortages affecting
        memory and related production, using an existing one-terabyte hard drive provided a practical and cost-effective
        solution. The system now functions as a centralized storage server within my home network, all while serving to 
        be a cunning solution to re-use old hardware.
    </p>

    <p>
        The server is currently used to store personal photos, game ROM files and ISO backups, and a media library
        accessible through Jellyfin. I have also hosted a Minecraft game server on the system, allowing friends and I to
        connect and play within a self-hosted environment.
    </p>

    <p>
        From a technical standpoint, maintaining consistent network access to the TrueNAS server required configuring a
        static address at the router level to preserve DNS resolution. I plan to expand this setup by adding a second
        hard drive to mirror the existing one for improved data redundancy, as well as exploring additional
        virtualization capabilities as my budget allows.
    </p>

    <p>
        Beyond the technical learning, this project demonstrated the real-world practicality of self-hosted services by
        reducing reliance on subscription-based cloud storage solutions.
    </p>

    <h3>Pi-hole & Network-Wide DNS Filtering</h3>

    <p>
        To further explore networking and DNS concepts, I implemented Pi-hole as a network-wide DNS filtering solution.
        This involved configuring the Pi-hole service, managing clients and settings, and updating router-level DNS
        configurations to route traffic through the Pi-hole instance.
    </p>

    <p>
        By handling DNS requests at the network level, Pi-hole blocks advertisements and tracking domains across all
        connected devices without requiring per-device configuration. Managing this system provided insight into how
        DNS operates within a network and how centralized services can improve both performance and security.
    </p>

    <h3>Reflection</h3>

    <p>
        Because these tools are actively used in my daily environment, homelabbing has been both a practical and
        rewarding experience. It has taught me more about operating systems, networking, storage, and system management
        than I initially expected, and it has resulted in tangible, useful systems that I continue to maintain and
        expand.
    </p>

        <h2>What I’m Working Toward</h2>

        <p>
            I am currently seeking an <span class="highlight">entry-level IT or cybersecurity internship</span> where I can continue
            to build practical experience, learn from professionals in the field, and contribute meaningfully to a team.
            I am especially interested in roles involving systems administration, networking, security operations,
            or infrastructure support.
        </p>

        <p>
            This website serves as a living record of my projects, learning process, and technical growth.
            Everything documented here reflects real systems I have built, configured, or broken — and then fixed.
