    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <!-- Profile Picture -->
    <img src="images/Me.png" alt="Photo of Lucas Wardlow" class="profile-pic">

    <p>
        My name is Lucas Wardlow and I am a college student pursuing a career in
        <span class="highlight">IT and Cybersecurity</span>, with a strong interest in how systems work beneath the surface.
        While much of my formal experience comes from coursework, I’ve intentionally focused on gaining hands-on exposure
        by building and experimenting with real systems on my own.
    </p>

    <p>
        I began creating home lab projects because I didn’t want my understanding of technology to remain purely inside
        the classroom. I wanted to know what actually happens when an operating system boots, how networking services
        interact, and how to fix what breaks when configurations are incorrect. Learning through direct experimentation,
        mistakes and all, has been one of the most valuable parts of my development.
    </p>

    <h2>How I Learn</h2>

    <p>
        My approach to learning is simple: build something, fix inevitable issues, and document what I learned.
        Through this process, I completed three hands-on projects that were both practically useful in my own environment
        and directly applicable to real-world IT concepts.
    </p>

    <section>
        <h2>Projects Overview</h2>

        <h3>Virtualization & Linux Command Line</h3>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/ubuntu-vm-terminal.png"
                 alt="Ubuntu virtual machine running in a command-line environment">
            <figcaption>
                Ubuntu virtual machine accessed through a remote university lab, used for Linux command-line navigation,
                user and group management, and compiling C programs.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            My exposure to virtualization began in a Computer Operating Systems course, where we were required to run a
            virtual machine hosted on a remote computer lab provided by the university. The process involved accessing
            the lab environment, installing Ubuntu, and configuring virtual machine specifications using VirtualBox.
        </p>

        <p>
            Once the virtual machine was configured, much of our interaction took place through the Linux command line.
            Because the virtual machines were hosted remotely, I continue to access my VM by remotely connecting to a
            school computer and launching it from there whenever I want to experiment or practice.
        </p>

        <p>
            This experience later proved valuable in a C Programming for Engineers course, where I worked extensively
            in a Unix-based terminal to navigate directories, compile code, and execute programs.
        </p>

        <h3>TrueNAS & Personal Storage Server</h3>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/truenas-dashboard.png"
                 alt="TrueNAS web dashboard showing storage and system status">
            <figcaption>
                TrueNAS dashboard showing active applications, storage management, and hosted services running on
                repurposed laptop hardware.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            To gain experience with storage and server administration, I repurposed an old laptop by installing TrueNAS
            as a dedicated operating system. The system is configured and managed remotely through the TrueNAS web
            interface.
        </p>

        <p>
            The server is used for centralized storage of photos, game ROM and ISO backups, media streaming via Jellyfin,
            and hosting a Minecraft server for friends. To maintain consistent access, I configured a static network
            address at the router level.
        </p>

        <p>
            I plan to expand this setup by adding a second hard drive for data mirroring and exploring additional
            virtualization capabilities as resources allow.
        </p>

        <h3>Pi-hole & Network-Wide DNS Filtering</h3>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/pihole-dashboard.png"
                 alt="Pi-hole dashboard showing blocked DNS queries">
            <figcaption>
                Pi-hole DNS filtering dashboard displaying real-time query statistics and network-wide ad blocking.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            To further explore networking concepts, I implemented Pi-hole as a network-wide DNS filtering solution.
            This involved configuring DNS settings at the router level and managing clients through the Pi-hole interface.
        </p>

        <p>
            By handling DNS requests centrally, Pi-hole blocks ads and tracking domains across all devices on the network
            without requiring per-device configuration.
        </p>

    </section>

    <h2>What I’m Working Toward</h2>

        <p>
            Because these systems are actively used in my daily environment, homelabbing has been both practical and
            fulfilling. It has resulted in tangible tools while significantly deepening my understanding of operating
            systems, networking, storage, and system administration.
        </p>
    
    <p>
        I am currently seeking an <span class="highlight">entry-level IT or cybersecurity internship</span> where I can
        continue to build hands-on experience, learn from professionals in the field, and contribute meaningfully to a team.
        I am especially interested in roles involving systems administration, networking, security operations, or
        infrastructure support.
    </p>

    <p>
        This website serves as a living record of my projects, learning process, and technical growth.
        Everything documented here reflects real systems I have built, configured, and fixed.
